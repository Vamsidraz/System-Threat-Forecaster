The goal of this project is to predict a systemâ€™s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that system. The telemetry data containing these properties and the system infections was generated by threat reports collected by system's antivirus software.

Each row in this dataset corresponds to a machine, uniquely identified by a MachineID. target is the ground truth and indicates that Malware was detected on the machine. Using the information and labels in train.csv, you must predict the value for target for each machine in test.csv
